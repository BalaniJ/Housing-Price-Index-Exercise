# Housing-Price-Index-Exercise
Using an ML and an OLS model to predict the National US HPI and explain how the features affect HPI individually.

The following is an exercise completed for the firm Home.LLC
In it, I have collected data on factors affecting the National House Price Index of the United States, measured monthly over the last 20 years.

It is both a Data Science as well an EDA exercise, where I have collected the data, cleaned it, analyzed the trends and insights, run a supervised learning algorithm, selected a candidate model, hyperparameter tuned it, predicted results, and presented my findings in a consolidated ppt.
I have also run a simple MLR OLS regression to explain the impact of individual factors/features on the dependent variable.
